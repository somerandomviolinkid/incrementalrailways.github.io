incremental train game

important things to note!!

fuel efficiency = fuel used for every tonne-kilometer, eg: fuel usage of 300 = 1 tonne can be carried 300 kilometers per liter of fuel

rollingstockstats is ALL rolling stock

main.js = main game stuff
train.js = train route code

routes.js intentionally has nothing in it, routes are added to it as the game progresses
